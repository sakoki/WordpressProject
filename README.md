## Project Goal:

Using configuration management tools like Terraform and Ansible, automate setting up wordpress and all of its dependencies. This exercise demonstrates the benefits of DevOps tools by standardizing the installation procedure, making complex manual tasks reproducible and less prone to error, speeding up overall development time.

Required Tools:

1. AWS (EC2)
2. Terraform
3. Ansible

## Steps:

1. [Install pre-requisite software on host machine](#Install-pre-requisite-software-on-host-machine)
2. [Set up Terraform to provision target server](#Set-up-Terraform-to-provision-target-server)
3. [Set up Ansible to install WordPress dependencies on target server](#Set-up-Ansible-to-install-WordPress-dependencies-on-target-server)
4. [Execute scripts to perform installation](#Execute-scripts-to-perform-installation)
5. [Validate installation of Wordpress](#Validate-installation-of-Wordpress)
